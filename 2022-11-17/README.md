### Talks

**Matt Edwards, Data Scientist @ National Innovation Centre for Data**

_Pre-event Workshop: Introduction to Databricks_

Following on from the talk [Databricks: Believing in Unicorns](https://www.meetup.com/newcastle-upon-tyne-data-science-meetup/events/287120959/)
we move from 'telling you' to 'showing you' how to become an end-to-end Machine
Learning specialist in Databricks. This workshop will include an end-to-end
Machine Learning example with the üç∑ dataset. We will cover how to import and
clean data; build, evaluate and tune models; and deploy them into production.

_Getting Insight from Anything_

The drive to make data-driven decisions shapes the strategy of many companies.
However, this dream has a problem: just because you need to make a decision
does not mean you have the data to make it! Often these decisions require data
from sources typically unconnected to the internet. This could be an architect
determined to understand how the construction of her building is progressing,
or a manufacturer wanting to live their best Industry 4.0 life. It's not
uncommon for companies to find this journey to become ‚Äúsmart‚Äù is a long one -
with difficult ethical ground to cover, or prohibitive costs associated with
procuring the necessary equipment. However, the development of cheap and
accessible IoT devices allows for the gathering of data from anything to be
more within reach than ever.

This talk will look at efforts within Waterstons to build proof-of-concept IoT
systems. We will discuss our (continuing) journey of using and managing
hardware and the problems we faced along the way. The main focus however will
be the software stack: Azure IoT Hub, Streaming Analytics, and the potential
Azure ML offerings that can be used to gain valuable insight from this data.

Speaker bio: Dr Andrew Blance is a Data Scientist at Waterstons, a North-East
based IT consultancy. His role primarily focuses on developing the data team‚Äôs
data science offering. This is split between data science as a service and
using MLOps to enable teams to deploy and scale models they have created. He
also spends time developing innovation projects - dabbling in IoT, computer
vision, and VR - intending to broaden the range of technology Waterstons can
offer clients. Honestly, though, his opus is Brains on the Outside, a podcast
about pitching ridiculous business ideas. Stop reading this, and go listen to
it!
