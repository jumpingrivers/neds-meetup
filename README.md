## The Event

_We are the North East Data Scientists, and we love all things data!_

We are an inclusive community which meets six times a year to listen to talks
from data innovators, experts, and enthusiasts, as well as to learn about the
latest data science tools and technologies with hands-on-workshops!

All our events are free-to-attend, and are a great opportunity to network with
like-minded data professionals, software developers, students, engineers, and
entrepreneurs. We meet in [the award-winning Catalyst building](https://www.google.com/maps/place//data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487e774a8501fda7:0x4e28e58fc4ec60fb?source=g.page.share)
in Newcastle upon Tyne.

We are sponsored by:
