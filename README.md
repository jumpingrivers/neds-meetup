## About

This repository holds the slides used in talks delivered in 2022 at the 
[North East Data Science meetup events](https://www.meetup.com/newcastle-upon-tyne-data-science-meetup/).

## The Event

We are North East Data Scientists, and we love all things data!

Our community meets six times a year to host our own speakers, and to network
with like-minded data scientists, software developers, students, engineers, and
entrepreneurs. We meet at The Catalyst in Newcastle upon Tyne.

We are sponsored by:

 - [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/), an analytics company whose
    passion is data and machine learning.

 - [The National Innovation Centre for Data (NICD)](https://www.nicd.org.uk/)

 - [The R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/)
