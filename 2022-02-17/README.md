_Data challenges in the payments industry_

Everyone understands transactions - you ask the barista for a cup of coffee,
tap your card, get your coffee and a couple of days later the money goes out of
your account - simple!

In reality this process is much more complex and involves data communication
between multiple different parties. Fintechs deal with data from multiple
disparate sources, in varying formats, with different specifications.
Understanding this data is key to operations.

This talk will outline the transaction lifecycle highlighting how data is
communicated between various parties, describe some of the challenges faced by
fintechs before taking a closer look at how we can compare data from disparate
sources.
