_Comparing package releases with diffify.com_

Say you were using a particular version of a package in a project and now a new
version is available. With Diffify you are easily able to check what has been
changed in the new release. In particular, Diffify will provide you with
information from the News file as well as changes in the dependencies,
namespace and functions of the package.

**Penny Pegman, Lead Data Scientist @ Department for Work and Pensions**

_Data Science in DWP_

Penny will give an overview of data science work in the Department for Work and
Pensions (DWP), and discuss how a team of DWP data scientists work closely with
the cross-disciplinary development teams that are designing and delivering new
features for the Universal Credit (UC) digital service. This session will show
how DWP data scientists use their expertise in UC datasets and data science
techniques to ensure the development of the service is supported by data,
helping to improve outcomes for UC claimants and DWP staff.
