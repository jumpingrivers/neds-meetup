_Introduction to H2O Driverless AI_

H2O Driverless AI is a proprietary tool developed by [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/)
to perform automatic machine learning without the need for coding. Automatic
machine learning is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine
learning to real-world problems. Driverless AI provides automatic feature
engineering, model validation, model tuning, model selection and deployment and
machine learning interpretability all within a user-friendly interface.

_Scaling R with AWS Lambda_

In this talk I will give an overview of a recent client project in which AWS
Lambda was used to provide a scalable R-backend for a public-facing web
application. This backend performed a number of different operations,
including; evaluating a Bayesian Network model; rendering a parameterised PDF
report via [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and creating data
visualisations with [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

All the code used in this project is [publicly available via GitHub](https://github.com/nationalarchives/DiAGRAM).

_Databricks: Believing in Unicorns_

Data science unicorns can develop data pipelines to clean and wrangle data;
develop statistical and machine learning models for estimation and prediction;
and deploy, monitor and maintain models in production. Unfortunately, the
existence of a definition does not imply the existence of that which is
defined. I never believed these data science unicorns existed. However, that
has changed. I have seen data scientists transform into unicorns with the magic
of Databricks and would like to share that magic with you.
