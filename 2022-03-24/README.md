### Talks

**Laura Wadkin, Research Associate @ Newcastle University**

_Using data to develop mathematical models for biological systems_ ([ðŸ”— slides](./2022-03-24-data-to-develop-models-for-bio-systems.pdf))

There are many biological systems requiring the development of descriptive and
predictive mathematical models (ranging from cellular systems to ocean
dynamics). As a Research Associate at Newcastle University, I work to develop
and apply the most appropriate mathematical methods to model these systems,
working with academic and industrial scientists from biological and ecological
backgrounds. In this talk I'll introduce some of the key main research areas in
mathematical biology and discuss how we develop models underpinned by real data
using two main case studies: models for cellular systems and models for
woodland resilience.

The NICD was created in response to a growing need for skilled data analysts
who can effectively utilise the growing volumes of data collected in the
information age. The NICD has a team of dedicated staff who work alongside new
or existing data analysis teams on a data driven project to train the next
generation of data scientists. The NICD have assisted in delivering a range of
projects for clients such as Newcastle Building Society, NHS BSA and Procter &
Gamble. This presentation is a whirlwind tour of all aspects of delivering a
data skills project from problem formation to statistical modelling through to
deployment.
